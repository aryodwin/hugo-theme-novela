I’ve been dreaming about writing consistently since a long time ago. I established my writing habit once, when I wrote my portfolio. Inspired by atomic habit principle, I wrote one sentence at least everyday. It worked, but when my study cases are finished, I stopped writing.

Currently I decided to start writing again because of two things: improve my communication, and structure my mind.

When I was pursuing my bachelor degree, my lecturer said that there’re two types of mind based on how they receive ideas: The glass box and the black box.

The glass box minded receives ideas based on observation and research. After they observe, read, and got some findings, they will be able to transform their understanding into ideas. Glass box needs time and materials in order to produce ideas.

In the other hand, The black box minded is type of mind that receive ideas intuitively. Ideas come along to them all of the sudden such a revelation. When we are in the toilet, while taking a walk, or while daydreaming, some brilliant ideas just show up. This type of mind usually owned by artists and creatives.

The problem is not like the glass box, the black box ideas is more abstract and unstructured. This make the black box minded difficult to articulate their ideas especially for the unexperienced one. Background and the process of the ideas is hard to describe sometimes. Unfortunately, this is not merely the problem for most entry level creatives and artist, but the most of people. The majority of us have marvelous ideas in our mind, yet it’s hard for us to transform them into sentences. The fruit of this obstacle is we have something in our mind but we don’t know what to say. It causes our great ideas not great anymore as it become useless.

Therefore, this is when the benefit of writing comes. Writing can help us structured our mind. It train our brains to think in a structure way. Writing creates a framework that can help us to articulate our ideas. And when your ideas is structured, it will be easy for you to communicate it through a sentence.
