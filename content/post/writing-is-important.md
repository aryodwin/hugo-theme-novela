I have been dreaming of writing consistently since a long time ago. I established my writing habit once when I wrote my portfolio. Inspired by the Atomic Habit principle, I wrote one sentence at least every day. It worked, but when my study cases are finished, I stopped writing.

Currently, I decided to start writing again because of two things: improve my communication and structure my mind.

When I was pursuing my bachelor's degree, my lecturer said that there are two types of mind based on how they receive ideas: The glass box and the black box.

The glass box minds receive ideas based on observation and research. After they observe, read, and get some findings, they will be able to transform their understanding into ideas. Glass box minds need time and materials to produce ideas.

On the other hand, the black box minds obtain ideas intuitively. Ideas come along to them suddenly such a revelation. When we are in the toilet, while taking a walk, or while daydreaming, some brilliant ideas just show up. This type of mind is usually owned by artists and creatives.

The problem is not like the glass box, the black box ideas are more abstract and unstructured. It makes black-box-minds difficult to articulate their ideas, especially for the inexperienced one. Background and the process of the idea are tough to describe sometimes. Unfortunately, this is not merely the problem for most entry-level creatives and artists, but most people. The majority of us have marvelous ideas in our minds, yet it’s hard to transform them into sentences. The fruit of this obstacle is we have something in our mind but we don’t know what to say. It causes our great ideas not great anymore as they become useless.

One of the ways to solve this problem is to practice your writing skill.  Writing helps us structure our minds. When you jot down your notions, your mind will be trained to think structurally. When you get used to it, your mind will create a framework of thinking that helps you to articulate your ideas. When ideas are structured, it will be easy to communicate them through a sentence. Additionally, your communication skill will get boosted.
